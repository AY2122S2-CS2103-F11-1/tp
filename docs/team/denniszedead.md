### Project: ManageEZPZ

ManageEZPZ is a desktop application that allows managers or supervisors to manage employees and assign tasks to them. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

## New features added

### `findTask` command

* To allow users to find tasks which was a new model added into our project.
* Allowed users to search tasks using multiple properties of a task.
* Created a new predicate `TaskMultiplePredicate` to filter out tasks based on multiple properties entered by users
* Added unit testing for:
  * `findTaskCommandParser` to check on different user inputs.
  * `findTaskCommand` to show different outcome on the `finteredTaskList` for different user inputs.
