### Project: ManageEZPZ

ManageEZPZ is a desktop application that allows managers or supervisors to manage employees and assign tasks to them. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Enhancement implemented

`findEmployee` command:
* Change  from `find` command to `findEmployee` command to reflect and differentiate this find command to find all employees.
* Create a new predicate `PersonMultiplePredicate` to filter out employees based on multiple properties entered by user.

`listEmployee` command
* Only change the command from `list` to `listEmployees` to reflect on listing down all the employees.
* Functionalities remain the same from AB3.

`findTask` command
* To allow users to find tasks which was a new model added into our project.
* Allowed users to search tasks using multiple properties of a task.
* Created a new predicate `TaskMultiplePredicate` to filter out tasks based on multiple properties entered by users

`listTask` command
* List down all the tasks in the filteredList.
