### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageezpz/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TaskList`, which `Task` references. This allows `TaskList` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />
</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageezpz/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* `JsonAddressBookStorage` has a `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, which have `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdaptedTask` to store and load both Persons and Tasks.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **Task Components**
- Added Classes into the model Component to encapsulate a Task.

#### **Implementation**
<img src="images/ModelTaskClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

A `Task`,
- is stored in `uniqueTaskList` of the Model
- can be represented by a `Todo`, `Event`, or `Deadline`

A `Task` contains the following attributes,
1. a `Description`, which represent the details of the Task to be stored in the `uniqueTaskList`
2. a `Date`, which represent the day, month and year as specified by a number of the Task
3. a `Time`, which represent the period during the Task exists or happens
4. can be assigned/Tagged to multiple different `Person`
5. a type, to differentiate between the different types of task
6. can be marked/unmarked based on whether the task is done or not.
7. can be assigned to a single `Priority` such as "LOW", "MEDIUM" or "HIGH"

#### Aspect: How the components within Task are added or changed
- **Current Choice**: Attributes within `Task` are immutable, meaning that if there is an attribute that has to be edited, a new Task object has to be created.
  * Pros: Concept of Immutability is met, making the code less prone to bugs as all components of an Task object are fixed
  * Cons: Less flexible, more steps needed in editing Task objects
- Alternative 1: Allow certain components within Task, like Time and Date to be mutable
  * Pros: Less overhead as fewer objects are created
  * Cons: Prone to error as a Component might not be correctly changed

### Task Adding feature

#### What is Task Adding feature about?

The Add Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature enhances `AddressBook` by allowing to store not only `Person`, but also `Task`. This is stored internally as a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTaskList`. Additionally, the feature implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#addTodo(Todo)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds the `Todo` Task to `UniqueTaskList`
* `AddressBook#addDeadline(Deadline)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the `Deadline` Task to `UniqueTaskList`
* `AddressBook#addEvent(Event)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the `Event` Task to `UniqueTaskList`

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `addTodo desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION` 
* `addDeadline desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION by/DATE TIME`
* `addEvent desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION at/DATE START_TIME END_TIME`

#### Implementation Flow of Task Adding feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Task Adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: ManageEZPZ comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. ManageEZPZ will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `addTodo desc/Watch Netflix with Mum` command to create a new `Todo` Task.
![AddTodo1](images/AddTodo.png)

#### Design considerations:
- The Task adding commands are straight-to-the-point and efficient for users to add Tasks to ManageEZPZ.
- The prefixes allow users to understand what the different types of Task need in order to be created.

#### UML Diagram for Adding Todo Task

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `addTodo` command:

<img src="images/AddTaskActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Tagging Task to Employee feature

#### What is Tagging Task to Employee feature about?

The Tag Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. 
This feature enhances `AddressBook` by allowing users to assign multiple `Person` to a `Task`. Additionally, the feature implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#tagTask(Task,Person)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Assign `Person` to `Task`
* `AddressBook#untagTask(Task,Person)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Deallocate the `Person` from `Task`

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `tagTask INDEX name/PERSON_NAME`
* `untagTask INDEX name/PERSON_NAME`

#### Implementation Flow of Tagging Task to Employee feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Tagging Task to Employee mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: ManageEZPZ comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. ManageEZPZ will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `tagTask 4 n/Alex Yeoh` command to assign `Alex Yeoh` to the 4th `Task`.
![AddTodo1](images/TagTask.png)

#### Design considerations:
- The Tagging commands are efficient for users to assign a `Person` to be in-charge of a `Task`.
- The Prefix allow users to simply input the name of the `Person` from ManageEZPZ.
- Users will be able to see the `Task` assigned to `Person` immediately after tagging.

#### UML Diagram for tagTask Command

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `tagTask` command:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Company Managers/Supervisors wants to keep track of all the tasks given to their subordinates
* They need to assign tasks to their subordinates as well
* Prefers typing commands instead of clicking buttons
* Needs a local database to store all tasks

**Value proposition**: 

* An application to show all the tasks assigned to the employees
* Tasks should be assigned to the employees as well
* Commands are typed using command lines
* All tasks created are stored in the local database

### User stories
