### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageezpz/ui/Ui.java))

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageezpz/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageezpz/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TaskList`, which `Task` references. This allows `TaskList` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Task` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />
</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/manageezpz/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* `JsonAddressBookStorage` has a `JsonSerializableAddressBook`, which have `JsonAdaptedPerson` and `JsonAdaptedTask` to store and load both Persons and Tasks.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Task Marking feature

#### What is Task Marking feature about?

The Mark Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows the user to mark a task as done.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `mark INDEX`

#### Implementation Flow of Task Marking feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Mark Task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user lists all the task by listing the task with the 'list' command.

Step 2. The user executes `mark 4` command to mark the task `Watch Netflix with Mum` as done.

![](images/MarkTask.png)

#### Design considerations

- The user is able to mark a task as done through the index specified in the list view.

#### UML Diagram for Task Marking

![](images/MarkClassDiagram.png)

### Task Unmarking feature

#### What is Task Unmarking feature about?

The Unmark Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows the user to mark a task as not done yet.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `unmark INDEX`

#### Implementation Flow of Task Unmarking feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Unmark Task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user lists all the task by listing the task with the 'list' command.

Step 2. The user executes `unmark 4` command to mark the task `Watch Netflix with Mum` as not done yet.

![](images/UnmarkTask.png)

#### Design considerations

- The user is able to mark a task as not done yet through the index specified in the list view.

![](images/UnmarkClassDiagram.png)

### Task Deleting feature

#### What is Task Deleting feature about?

The Delete Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows the user to delete a task.

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `delete INDEX`

#### Implementation Flow of Task Deleting feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Delete Task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user lists all the task by listing the task with the 'list' command.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 4` command to delete the task `Watch Netflix with Mum`.

![](images/DeleteTask.png)

#### Design considerations

- The user is able to delete a task as through the index specified in the list view.

#### UML Diagram for Task Deleting

![](images/DeleteClassDiagram.png)


### **Task Components**
- Added Classes into the model Component to encapsulate a Task.

#### **Implementation**
<img src="images/ModelTaskClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

A `Task`,
- is stored in `uniqueTaskList` of the Model
- can be represented by a `Todo`, `Event`, or `Deadline`

A `Task` contains the following attributes,
1. a `Description`, which represent the details of the Task to be stored in the `uniqueTaskList`
2. a `Date`, which represent the day, month and year as specified by a number of the Task
3. a `Time`, which represent the period during the Task exists or happens
4. can be assigned/Tagged to multiple different `Person`
5. a type, to differentiate between the different types of task
6. can be marked/unmarked based on whether the task is done or not.
7. can be assigned to a single `Priority` such as "LOW", "MEDIUM" or "HIGH"

#### Design considerations:

#### Aspect: How the components within Task are added or changed
- **Current Choice**: Attributes within `Task` are immutable, meaning that if there is an attribute that has to be edited, a new Task object has to be created.
  * Pros: Concept of Immutability is met, making the code less prone to bugs as all components of an Task object are fixed
  * Cons: Less flexible, more steps needed in editing Task objects
- Alternative 1: Allow certain components within Task, like Time and Date to be mutable
  * Pros: Less overhead as fewer objects are created
  * Cons: Prone to error as a Component might not be correctly changed

### Task Adding feature

#### What is Task Adding feature about?

The Add Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature enhances `AddressBook` by allowing to store not only `Person`, but also `Task`. This is stored internally as a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTaskList`. Additionally, the feature implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#addTodo(Todo)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds the `Todo` Task to `UniqueTaskList`
* `AddressBook#addDeadline(Deadline)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the `Deadline` Task to `UniqueTaskList`
* `AddressBook#addEvent(Event)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds the `Event` Task to `UniqueTaskList`

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `addTodo desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION` 
* `addDeadline desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION by/DATE TIME`
* `addEvent desc/TASK_DESCRIPTION at/DATE START_TIME END_TIME`

#### Implementation Flow of Task Adding feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Task Adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: ManageEZPZ comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. ManageEZPZ will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `addTodo desc/Watch Netflix with Mum` command to create a new `Todo` Task.
![AddTodo1](images/AddTodo.png)

#### Design considerations:
- The Task adding commands are straight-to-the-point and efficient for users to add Tasks to ManageEZPZ.
- The prefixes allow users to understand what the different types of Task need in order to be created.

#### UML Diagram for Adding Todo Task

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `addTodo` command:

<img src="images/AddTaskActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />


### Editing details of a task

The edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditTaskCommandParser` and `EditTaskCommand`. <br/>
`EditTaskCommandParser.parse()` - parses the input by the user and returns a `EditTaskCommand` object. <br/>
`EditTaskCommand.execute()` - creates a new `Task` object based on the parsed user input and calls `Model.setTask()`
to replace the old `Task` object with the new `Task` object.

The command is as follows: taskEdit [TASK_INDEX] desc/ [DESC] at/ [TIME] date/ [DATE]

- [TASK_INDEX] must not be empty.
- At least one of [DESC], [TIME] and [DATE] should not be empty.
- desc/ [DESC], at/ [TIME] or date/ [DATE] may be omitted but all of them cannot be omitted at the same time.

Below is a sequence diagram of the editing of a task.

![EditTaskSequenceDiagram](images/EditTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user executes a `editTask 1 desc/ eat` to edit the 1st task in the address book. The `editTask` command
in `AddressBookParser` calls `EditTaskCommandParser.parse()`
and parses the task index which is given as 1 and the task description that the
user wants to edit his task with is parsed as a String with value eat.

If either the description or the date or time was not provided by the user, then the default value
would be an empty String. Otherwise, it would be parsed as a String with value provided by the user.
It is not the responsibility of `EditTaskCommandParser.parse()` to ensure that the input provided by the user is valid.
It will however ensure that a `Task` index is provided and
at least the description or date or time has a corresponding value.

Step 2.  
In `LogicManager`, `EditTaskCommand.execute()` is called. This `EditTaskCommand` object is the one that was returned
by `EditTaskCommandParser.parse()`. Within the `execute()` method,  there are 3 cases to consider.

1. The task is of type Todo.
2. The task is of type Deadline.
3. The task is of type Event.

Each case is being handled separately by its corresponding handler method.

In general, what each handler method will do is to ensure that the input provided
by the user is valid and if so, create a new `Task` object with the given input and
call `model.setTask()` to replace the old `Task` object
with the new `Task` object. If there are some input which is not provided, then the default value would be the
same value as the old `Task` object. If any input is not valid, a `ParseException` is thrown.

For `editTask 1 desc/ eat`, in step 1, we have obtained the task index which is given as 1.
Using `model.getFilteredTaskList().get(index)` we obtain a copy of the task that the user wants to edit.
Next, depending on what type the obtained task is, the corresponding handler method is called.

If the task is of type Todo, then the handler method will create a new `Todo` object with the description value as
"eat", call `model.setTask()` and return a CommandResult showing that the update has been successful.

If the task is of type Deadline, then the handler method will create a new `Deadline` object with the description
value as "eat", and the date and time values set to be the same
values from the copy obtained using `model.getFilteredTaskList().get(index)`. Then, `model.setTask()` is called and
return a CommandResult showing that the update has been successful.

If the task is of type Event, then the handler method will create a new `Event` object with the description
value as "eat", and the date and time values set to be the same
value from the copy obtained using `model.getFilteredTaskList().get(index)`. Then, `model.setTask()` is called and
return a CommandResult showing that the update has been successful.

<b>Note:</b> For the Event type, a String value with two time values corresponding to be the start and end time
separated with an **empty space** must be provided. Other than the time values being valid,
the range between the start and end time must be valid as well. For example, 1700 2000 is valid while 2000 1700 is not.

### **The `Find` command**
- The ``Find`` command has two seperate arguments `task/` and `day/`
- The `task/` argument has an additional `desc/` as a keyword which is the search term to search for all the tasks that
  contains the keyword
- `day/` arguments searches for either the deadline or the event that has this date as the deadline/ event that will
  be held

#### How it is implemented
1. When the user enters the find command, the FindCommandParser searches for either the `task/` or the `day/` argument
2. Then, the FindCommandParser will self invoke either the `findCommandTask()` or `findCommandDate()` respectively.
3. `findCommandTask()` will return the FindCommand that searches for all the task which contains the given keyword whereas `findCommandDate()` searches for deadline/event with the given date
4. The FindCommand will execute and update the Model with the updateFilteredTaskList where the filtered task list will be updated with the tasks that statisfy the predicate
5. After execution, the FindCommand will return the CommandResult that contains a string of the outcome of the command.

#### Sequence diagram when a user enters the command `find task/ desc/ Genshin`

<img src="images/FindTask.png" width="450" />

#### Improvements needed
* As we are also listing employees as well, we also need an argument that searches for the number of people instead
* In v1.3, as priority tagging is implemented for all tasks, we also need an argument to find all tasks.
* For employee searching, we can also implement more arguments to search for an employee using the employee's components
  as the search term.


### **The `List` command**
- The `List` command shows all the tasks in the list.
- It has arguments such as `todo/`, `deadline/` and `event/` which searches for all todos, deadlines and events respectively.

#### How it is implemented
1. When the user enters `List`, the ListCommandParser will simply return a ListCommand
2. If the user enters additional options such as `todo/`, `deadline/` and `events/`, ListCommandParse will then check if the user enters a valid option. ListCommandParse will throw an ParseException if the user enters an invalid option, or more than 1 option.
3. When the ListCommand is executed, it will update the model to show all the task in the task list
4. If options are provided, the command will update the model with all tasks with the specified task type.
5. After execution, ListCommand will return a CommandResult that contains the message of the outcome of the command


#### Sequence diagram when the user enters `list todo/`

<img src="images/List.png" width="450"/>

#### Improvements to be added
* We feel that the options may be better suited for the find option
* The tasks needs to be updated into the UI.

### Tagging Task to Employee feature

#### What is Tagging Task to Employee feature about?

The Tag Task mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. 
This feature enhances `AddressBook` by allowing users to assign multiple `Person` to a `Task`. Additionally, the feature implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#tagTask(Task,Person)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Assign `Person` to `Task`
* `AddressBook#untagTask(Task,Person)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Deallocate the `Person` from `Task`

For the command, the feature extends `command`, and is implemented as such:
* `tagTask INDEX name/PERSON_NAME`
* `untagTask INDEX name/PERSON_NAME`

#### Implementation Flow of Tagging Task to Employee feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Tagging Task to Employee mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: ManageEZPZ comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. ManageEZPZ will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `tagTask 4 n/Alex Yeoh` command to assign `Alex Yeoh` to the 4th `Task`.
![AddTodo1](images/TagTask.png)

#### Design considerations:
- The Tagging commands are efficient for users to assign a `Person` to be in-charge of a `Task`.
- The Prefix allow users to simply input the name of the `Person` from ManageEZPZ.
- Users will be able to see the `Task` assigned to `Person` immediately after tagging.

#### UML Diagram for tagTask Command

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `tagTask` command:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Company Managers/Supervisors wants to keep track of all the tasks given to their subordinates
* They need to assign tasks to their subordinates as well
* Prefers typing commands instead of clicking buttons
* Needs a local database to store all tasks

**Value proposition**:

* An application to show all the tasks assigned to the employees
* Tasks should be assigned to the employees as well
* Commands are typed using command lines
* All tasks created are stored in the local database

### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`
